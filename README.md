# Prediction-of-hardness-of-HEAs
The hardness of high entropy alloy can be obtained by inputting components by examples. Include 15 elements, Al Co Cr Cu Fe Ni Mo Ti W Nb Ta V Mn HF Zr.
Please enter the atomic percentage (at.%) of each element in "calculate_features_and_hardness.xlsx". 
After running the code, the predicted hardness in HV will automatically appear in the 16th column of the source file.
According to the form in "calculate_features_and_hardness.xlsx", you can also calculate features(ad-YM	VEC	e/a	ad-r	δ	ΔH	ad-e/a	r	ad- SHA	ad- Tm	SM	Δs	Ω) by the code.
Please run it in python and install all the dependent libraries.
