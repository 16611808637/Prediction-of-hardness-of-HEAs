# Prediction-of-hardness-of-HEAs
The hardness of high entropy alloy can be obtained by inputting components by examples. Include 15 elements, Al Co Cr Cu Fe Ni Mo Ti W Nb Ta V Mn HF Zr.
Please enter the atomic percentage (at.%) of each element in "The calculation of features.xlsx". 
After running the code, the predicted hardness in HV will automatically appear in the 16th column of the source file.
Please run it in python and install all the dependent libraries.
