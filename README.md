# Prediction-of-hardness-of-HEAs
Welcome to **High-throughput Screening Platform** of **hardness prediction** and **thermodynamic parameter calculation** for **high-entropy alloys (HEAs)**. 
The operation of this platform is very friendly for materials scientists who have no programming foundation. 
You need to install the corresponding python library and run the prediction code. 
Specifically, the hardness of high entropy alloy can be obtained by inputting components by examples. Include 15 elements, Al Co Cr Cu Fe Ni Mo Ti W Nb Ta V Mn HF Zr.
Please enter the atomic percentage (at.%) of each element in "calculate_features_and_hardness.xlsx". 
After running the code, the predicted hardness in HV will automatically appear in the 16th column of the source file.
According to the form in "calculate_features_and_hardness.xlsx", you can also calculate features(ad-YM	VEC	e/n	ad-r	δ	ΔH	ad-e/a	r	ad- SHA	ad- Tm	SM	Δs	Ω x ) by the code.
Please run it in python and install all the dependent libraries.
**For reference to detailed information, I would recommend consulting our article that is currently under review.**
As it is in the process of being evaluated, the specific details of the references will be available only after the final approval of the article. 
Thank you for your understanding and patience.
