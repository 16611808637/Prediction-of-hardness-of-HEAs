# Prediction-of-hardness-of-HEAs
The hardness of high entropy alloy can be obtained by inputting components by examples. Include 15 elements, Al Co Cr Cu Fe Ni Mo Ti W Nb Ta V Mn HF Zr.
Please enter the atomic percentage (at.%) of each element in "The calculation of features.xlsx". 
After running the code, the predicted hardness in HV will automatically appear in the 16th column of the source file.
